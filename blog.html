     That people are very selﬁsh. All they can think is of themselves, nothing else. Everyone locked down at their homes is thinking of when this 
     lockdown would end and they would be free to escape these cages. My dear friends, this is not a cage, this is your own home, your comfort zone.
      But they wont realize this, because nowadays everyone is so engulfed with the social life, that all the virtual world has become their comfort
       zone. They don't need their real people with them. They aren't missing the escapism, they are missing posting photographs portraying their 
       fake social life.  The doctors, policemen, vendors, social workers, are working their best as our life saviors. And what are we doing? Lying
        on our beds till 10 am, that too because we spent the last night posting some fake happy pictures on our social media for the greed of likes 
        d comments? These people haven't visited their families, haven't been in contact with their comfortable beds for more than a month, and still
         they are working relentlessly for all of us. Some doctors haven't seen their own new born baby, some haven't been able to see their dead 
         family. The policemen are getting beaten up for protecting their nation. No one is stopping the foolish people who are beating the police. 
         Everybody just watches this on TV and ignores. There are engineers who are working hard for developing the medical apps, there are vendors
          who are risking their lives to provide us with our food amenities, just to earn their daily bread. And how are we helping them? The least 
          we can do is stay home in this lockdown and cooperate. Everyone has a problem with this too! They haven't complained once about their hardships, and we are shamelessly complaining here about our huge problem:"I cant stay home I want to get out". They haven't eaten properly, and we are busy savoring May-mangoes and choco chip puddings? How selﬁsh of us? Have you ever given a thought? I am sure you have not. Think about it now, this is the time to become selﬂess!

          That people dont want a holiday they want a vacation.  Now when everyone is getting a free holiday for a month and more, no one wants it.
           at all the other times, everyone just boot licks their boss to grant them a holiday so that they can travel the world. This is the truth, 
           that no one wants a holiday to spend time at their home; rather everybody just wants to escape and travel around the world, and just post 
           photos and display a fake image that we are such a happy family/ or a happy couple.

            That social media is controlling us. How many of us have not posted a single thing we did in this lockdown? I m sure quite a few people..probably not even 10%. Why? Because it's all about social media. Cook a pancake, post it on Instagram. Book a movie ticket, post it on Instagram. Can you even make a round size chapati? And you are busy posting all ready made pancakes and pastries. Never attended a drawing class or taken a drawing exam, yet people have become such great artists to post their amateur paintings equivalent to some 1st std child; they feel that they have become artists in one night. Why? To show off that we have become painters, chefs and all types of artists.Read a new book, open some random page, with a coffee mug in your hand, with your legs spread in the gallery of your house, and there it goes; your cliche Instagram post. Had u ever read books you have understood what shit you are doing and getting into. Books would have made you more mature to not post every page you read. Playing online games, video calling your friends, missing them, all this is okay but pay heed to your family once? When adversity strikes, it is the family which is by u, and not your fake social media likes. Never have u helped your mom in the kitchen or in cleaning the house. And suddenly now, you realize that kitchen work and household chores are so diﬃcult? Why? Because you have to do it all now? It's all on you now? And is it mandatory to post every title you sweep and every utensil you wash? Your mom and your maid has fulﬁlled these duties for years, yet have you ever thanked her in personal for making your things easy? No. Do that ﬁrst and then post her smile. It will be a much better post. Read a book, atleast one, genuinely
            and inculcate whatever you have learnt through it in your life, and then post what you have learnt; this would be a better moral. Paint a smile on your mom thanking her for everything and cook something for your dad and post their smiles on your account; than posting your 1 day skills. This would make them feel better personally. Uninstall those online games, and video calling apps; play oﬄine games with your family, and chitchat with them personally. Consider this lockdown as a break from your tedious and fake social media life. There is a life beyond your social media likes, your girlfriend, boyfriend and your friends. Uninstall all the apps, and enjoy with your family, spend time with them, without even posting how much minutes you spent and what all you did. Believe me, this is a much better feeling. You never know your family would be there with you tomorrow or not, this virus has its hands all over the world. Use this lockdown for such good purposes; learn a new skill, study hard (you won't get this time again), relax a bit, contribute to your society, nurture your hobbies( at home) but there isn't a necessity to post all this ! Keep it personal.
